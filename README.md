## About the Book
This book will take you on an engaging experience to understand SQL querying from the most basic to the most expert level, using various SQL techniques to extract valuable insights from your MariaDB databases. The adventure will begin with the most basic level and end with the most professional level.

This book's first section provides an introduction to the fundamental concepts of both SQL and MariaDB. It then guides users through building queries using simple and then more complex table joins and progressively more powerful data filtering to generate advanced queries utilizing various SQL techniques. The reader will understand MariaDB database analysis better by learning the basics of SQL computation, relational logic, and data grouping and aggregation. Also covered are SQL basics like formatting queries, making subqueries, making derived tables, joining and filtering tables, etc. In addition, the book explains how to conduct rolling analysis, investigate time-series data, and manage enormous and complex MariaDB datasets.

When readers have finished the book, they can devise their techniques for analyzing relational MariaDB datasets and acquiring the necessary insights.
